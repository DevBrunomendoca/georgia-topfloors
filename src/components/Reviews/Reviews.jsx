Everyone at Georgia Top Floors are extremely professional and have amazing work ethics, from the office workers to the guys on the ground. There's no one else I'd even think about using for any flooring work.",

Scheduled a next day consultation to take measurements of my home and went out of their way to make sure they matched my current floors perfectly. Pricing was reasonable and set at market value. They started the job within a week and finished within a few days. I‚Äôm absolutely impressed by their work and the attention to detail. Would use them again and again! Highly recommend.",

        "My experience with Georgia Top Floors has been great. I was referred to them by my general contractor and within 24 hours of contacting them, they were out at my house to show me some flooring samples and to take initial measurements. The work was efficient and the project managers were in constant communication with me throughout the process. I can be a bit picky and particular about colors/finishes and they were so patient  and worked with me to get my stairs matched to my floors to my liking. I would definitely use Georgia Top Floors in the future!",

They are priced very competitively and are also very accessible when you want to communicate with them at all times. They put floors in our recently purchased home, they arrived on-time and did exactly what they quoted. We are very happy with the results! We strongly recommend them!",
